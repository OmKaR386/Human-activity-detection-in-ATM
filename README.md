 Video Surveillance plays a pivotal role in
todayâ€™s world. The technologies have been advanced too
much when artificial intelligence, machine learning and
deep learning pitched into the system. Using above
combinations, different systems are in place which helps
to differentiate various suspicious behaviors from the live
tracking of footages. The most unpredictable one is
human behaviour and it is very difficult to find whether
it is suspicious ornormal. Deep learning approach is used
to detect suspicious or normal activity in an academic
environment, and which sends an alert message to the
corresponding authority, in case of predicting a
suspicious activity. Monitoring is often performed
through consecutive frames which are extracted from the
video. The entire framework is divided into two parts. In
the first part, the features are computed from video
frames and in secondpart, based on the obtained features
classifier predict the class as suspicious ornormal.
